# ClashRoyaleDeckCalculator
a calculator that will get your profile's data, and calculate the perfect deck based on the unlocked cards and their levels, and arena. 
Also I'm a complete idiot so i need help getting started LOL. neural network? or just a huge database... would it need a perfect clash royale clone that has a proper api where you can battle? or has someone created a (somewhat illegal) one already, maybe even for the real game? (IK an official API does exist, but you can't battle with it, only look at stats and clan chat and stuff :(
