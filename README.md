# ClashRoyaleDeckCalculator
a calculator that will get your profile's data, and calculate the perfect deck based on the unlocked cards and their levels, and arena (and king level if relevant). 
Also I'm a complete idiot so i need help getting started LOL. neural network? or just a huge database... would it need a perfect clash royale clone that has a proper api where you can battle? or has someone created a (somewhat illegal) one already, maybe even for the real game? (IK an official API does exist, but you can't battle with it, only look at stats and clan chat and stuff :(
DM me on discord at JimmyTheGreat100#1744 if youre interested in helping this happen (or just set up an issue or even a pr ig?); i dont think anything like this exists anywhere and this would be revolutionary to mobile gaming if this works...
